            Community energy refers to multiple energy sources and distribution networks that are shared between various members of a geographic neighbourhood, with at least part of the energy generated in the local area. This usually means some degree of local involvement in the management and control of the system, with sharing of responsibilities, benefits, and impacts among the community.
