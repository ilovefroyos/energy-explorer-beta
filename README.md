## Setup

There are 2 ways to run this project locally on your machine. If you're on mac, you can consider to use the local PHP server that's already part of the MacOS:

### Option 1: MacOS only

```
$ cd energy-explorer-beta
$ php -S localhost:9000
```

see the page at: [localhost:9000](localhost:9000)

NOTE: some issues might arise with the way the local PHP server is running which leads to weird URL related wonkiness. Be cognizant that you may run into issues when deploying when working around URL masking etc. 

### Option 2: MacOS & Windows

Or you can download and use a [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/). The thing about MAMP is that you just have to always be working with your project within the MAMP file structure which isn't always ideal. 


For `user.passw`: contact repo admin.
